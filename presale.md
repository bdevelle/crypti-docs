Crypti pre-sale instructions
==========


## What is Crypti?
**Crypti** is a new crypto-currency designed from the ground up to solve the biggest problem with other currencies - a lack of purchase motivation. Crypti is being built from scratch, and does not rely on any other crypto-currency code.


## Ok. Let's buy.
Buying Crypti takes a few easy steps described below.

### Step one
Send BTC to one of Crypti pre-sale addresses listed below.

**NOTE:** Make sure to send only from a desktop or web wallet where you control your own keys!
Do not sent from exchange, Coinbase or any other such managed service.

**NOTE 2:** Make sure to remember what address you have used for sending. It is best to label it with some meaningful ID.


### Step two
Create a new Crypti wallet at:
http://test.crypti.me
**NOTE:** make sure to save or write down your password! Without the password, you won’t be able to access the wallet and your Crypti will be lost!


### Step three
Once the pre-sale is over, browse to the online issuance system at http://crypti.me/issue (will be online soon) and copy the confirmation message posted there. Sign the message with the address you used to send BTC, and copy / paste the signature to the online issuance system.

The online issuance system will be matched your signature against your sending BTC address. Once matched successfully, the system will ask for your Crypti address, so it can issue the Crypti coins to the Crypti address.


## Pre-sale addresses
### Escrowed pre-sale
There will be two options - direct escrow via Maxmint, and exchange escrow via Dgex.com.

1) The direct escrow service will be provided by respected Bitcointalk community member Maxmint. Investors will send the amount of their investments to Maxmint’s wallet:

* Wallet owner: Maxmint
* Wallet Address: YYY
* Minimum transaction of 0.01 BTC

2) The exchange escrow service will be provided by respected exchange Dgex. Investors could either use their BTC or NXT (with conversion to BTC) balances on Dgex, or deposit the amount of their buy orders to Dgex exchange.

* Wallet owner: Dgex


After the completion of the launch of the main net, the escrow services will facilitate the transfer of BTC to the Crypti team, in exchange for Crypti distribution to buyers. 


## Crypti allocation
The total amount of Crypti in existence will be 100 Million. The pre-sale will last 30 days and we will accept Bitcoin only. 

* 75% of the genesis block will be allocated to the pre-sale auction and will be sold to the community
* 15% of the genesis block will be allocated to the initial buyer, the creator and lead developer of the project, and the Crypti team, to ensure post-launch development of Crypti. These Crypti amounts will be released on a vested schedule, and kept in a public account so all transactions can be monitored
* 0 - 10% (sliding scale, see below) of the genesis block will be allocated as a part of ongoing payment to the Crypti development team. These Crypti amounts (if any remain) will be released as a development funding mixed with the raised BTC, in ratio that will be decided by the Foundation

## How the bonus works?
In order to encourage people not to wait until the last day to invest, an investment structure rewarding early adopters will be used. A bonus of 30% increase in stake will be awarded at the beginning of the pre-sale. The bonus will be applied to the total resulting amount of coins, which will be 75% plus any additional ones from the 10%. This will be continuously reduced by 1% each day over the course of the sale to a final 0% bonus at the end of the sale.
