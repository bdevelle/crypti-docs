Crypti pre-sale instructions
==========


## What is Crypti?
**Crypti** is a new crypto-currency designed from the ground up to solve the biggest problem with other currencies - a lack of purchase motivation. Crypti is being built from scratch, and does not rely on any other crypto-currency code.


## Ok. Let's buy.
You can easily buy Crypti via one of the following methods:

* Bter.com exchange
* Maxmint

Both these methods are fully escrowed, to ensure the safety of your BTC.

### Bter.com
* Crypti buy fee: 0%
* Withdrawal fee: 1% + 1 Crypti
* Supports refunds

#### Step one
Register on Bter.com (if you don’t have an account yet), or login.

#### Step two
Deposit BTC to Bter.com (if it’s a new account, or you have an empty balance).

#### Step three
Browse to Crypti sale on CRSALE / BTC exchange pair, and buy CRSALE tokens in exchange for BTC:
https://bter.com/trade/crsale_btc

#### Step four
Once the pre-sale is over, your purchased CRSALE tokens will be converted to Crypti, based on the amount of CRSALE you hold, and the total funds raised on the pre-sale. You could then withdraw them to you Crypti wallet.


### Bter.com
* Crypti buy fee: 1%
* Minimum transaction of 0.01 BTC

#### Step one
Send the amount of BTC you would like to buy Crypti for, to Maxmint BTC address XXX.

**NOTE:** Make sure to send only from a desktop or web wallet where you control your own keys!
Do not sent from exchange, Coinbase or any other such managed service.

**NOTE 2:** Make sure to remember what address you have used for sending. It is best to label it with some meaningful ID.


#### Step two
Create a new Crypti wallet at:
http://crypti.me:6040
**NOTE:** make sure to save or write down your password! Without the password, you won’t be able to access the wallet and your Crypti will be lost!


#### Step three
Once the pre-sale is over, browse to the online issuance system at http://crypti.me/issue (will be online towards the pre-sale end) and copy the confirmation message posted there. Sign the message with the address you used to send BTC (for example: http://imgur.com/a/nUmZ0), and copy & paste the signature to the online issuance system.

The online issuance system will match your signature against your sending BTC address. Once matched successfully, the system will ask for your Crypti address, so it can issue the Crypti 
coins.

## How the bonus works?
In order to encourage people not to wait until the last day to invest, an investment structure rewarding early adopters will be used. A bonus of 30% increase in stake will be awarded at the beginning of the pre-sale. The bonus will be applied to the total resulting amount of coins, which will be 75% plus any additional ones from the 10%. This will be continuously reduced by 1% each day over the course of the sale to a final 0% bonus at the end of the sale.
