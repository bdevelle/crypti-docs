Crypti pre-sale instructions
==========


## What is Crypti?
**Crypti** is a new crypto-currency designed from the ground up to solve the biggest problem with other currencies - a lack of purchase motivation. Crypti is being built from scratch, and does not rely on any other crypto-currency code.


## Ok. Let's buy.
You can easily buy Crypti via one of the following methods:

* Bter.com exchange
* Maxmint

Both these methods are fully escrowed, to ensure the safety of your BTC.

### Bter.com
* Crypti buy fee: 0%
* Withdrawal fee: 1% + 1 Crypti
* Supports refunds

#### Step one
Register on Bter.com (if you don’t have an account yet), or login.

#### Step two
Deposit BTC to Bter.com (if it’s a new account, or you have an empty balance).

#### Step three
Browse to Crypti sale on CRSALE / BTC exchange pair, and buy CRSALE tokens in exchange for BTC:
https://bter.com/trade/crsale_btc

These tokens will be sold on 1:1 ratio to BTC, serving as a proof of the pre-sale purchase. The CRSALE tokens will not be tradeable.

#### Step four
Once the pre-sale is over, your purchased CRSALE tokens will be converted to Crypti, based on the amount of CRSALE you hold, and the total funds raised on the pre-sale. You could then withdraw them to you Crypti wallet.


### Maxmint
* Crypti buy fee: 1%
* Minimum transaction of 0.01 BTC

#### Step one
Read the escrow details posted here: http://bit.ly/crypti_escrow. Then, send the amount of BTC you would like to buy Crypti for, to Maxmint BTC address listed here:
http://bit.ly/crypti_escrow

**NOTE:** Make sure to send only from a desktop or web wallet where you control your own keys!
Do not sent from exchange, Coinbase or any other such managed service.

A transaction can have multiple inputs. If your transaction has multiple inputs then the largest input will be considered as the relevant investment address.

**NOTE 2:** Make sure to remember what address you have used for sending. It is best to label it with some meaningful ID.


#### Step two
Create a new Crypti wallet at:
http://crypti.me:6040
**NOTE:** make sure to save or write down your password! Without the password, you won’t be able to access the wallet and your Crypti will be lost!


#### Step three
Once the pre-sale is over, browse to the online issuance system at http://crypti.me/issue (will be online towards the pre-sale end) and copy the confirmation message posted there. Sign the message with the address you used to send BTC (for example: http://imgur.com/a/nUmZ0), and copy & paste the signature to the online issuance system.

The online issuance system will match your signature against your sending BTC address. Once matched successfully, the system will ask for your Crypti address, so it can issue the Crypti 
coins.


## Crypti Foundation
In order to ensure the ongoing Crypti development, marketing and promotion, a Crypti Foundation will be established. The Foundation will consist from members of the launch team, and from the publicly elected community members.

The foundation will control the raised funds in a publicly visible BTC wallet for transparency, and issue spending reports on a monthly fashion. The foundation will also control the vested Crypti of the launch team, and distribute them over the vested schedule.

The BTC funds will be kept in multi-singature enabled wallet, with multiple private keys distributed among the foundation members, for an increased safety of the funds.

The foundation will be eligible to replace it’s members and Crypti employees, based on their performance and public voting.

A detailed Foundation charter will be published for the community review during the pre-sale period.


## Pre-sale details

### Pre-sale cap
In order to ensure fair and equal distribution, each buyer will be limited to a 2% maximum of the total funds raised. Any buyer who buys more than 2% will be refunded the excess funds over the 2% limit.

### Crypti allocation
The total amount of Crypti in existence will be 100 Million. The pre-sale will The total amount of Crypti in existence will be 100 Million. The pre-sale will last 30 days and we will accept Bitcoin only. 

* 75% of the genesis block will be allocated to the pre-sale auction and will be sold to the community.
* 15% of the genesis block will be allocated to the initial buyer, the creator and lead developer of the project, and the Crypti team, to ensure post-launch development of Crypti. These Crypti amounts will be released on a vested schedule, and kept in a public account so all transactions can be monitored.
* 0 - 10% (sliding scale, see below) of the genesis block will be allocated as a part of ongoing payment to the Crypti development team. These Crypti amounts (if any remain) will be released as a development funding mixed with the raised BTC, in ratio that the Foundation will decide upon.

### Launch team vesting
The Crypti team allocation will be time-vested according to time-blocks, with release points **every 3 months**, in coordination with code releases. The vesting will be spread over one year. Each payout will be approved by the Crypti foundation.


### Development Funds / Initial Distribution
The Crypti team 0-10% sliding scale will be adjusted based on the amount of BTC raised in the pre-sale, lowering by 1% for every 50 BTC raised in the pre-sale, e.g.:

* 0 BTC = 10%
* 50 BTC = 9%
* 100 BTC = 8%
* 150 BTC = 7%
* 200 BTC = 6%
* 250 BTC = 5%
* 300 BTC = 4%
* 350 BTC = 3%
* 400 BTC = 2%
* 450 BTC = 1%
* 500 BTC = 0%

Any percentage not allocated to the Crypti team will be distributed among the genesis block buyers.


### Crypti allocation formula
TB = Total amount of BTC collected via Bter and Maxmint

TC = Total amount of Crypti distributed to buyers

D = Day of purchase

B = Amount of Bitcoins sent by a buyer

C = Amount of Crypti a buyer receives

F = Fraction of the buyer stake in total Crypti distributed

_F = B * (1+ (30 - D) / 30 ) / TB_

_TC = 75,000,000 + 20,000 * TB, maximum 85,000,000 for TB equal to or more than 500 BTC_

_C = TC * F = (75,000,000 + 20,000 * TB) * (B * (1+(30 - D) / 30) / TB)_


## How does the bonus work
In order to encourage people not to wait until the last day to invest, an investment structure rewarding early adopters will be used. A bonus of 30% increase in stake will be awarded at the beginning of the pre-sale. The bonus will be applied to the total resulting amount of coins, which will be 75% plus any additional ones from the 10%. This will be continuously reduced by 1% each day over the course of the sale to a final 0% bonus at the end of the sale.


## How does the refund work
Bter.com will enable buyers to refund their CRSALE purchases within the pre-sale period, as per following guidelines:
* Within the first 20 days of the pre-sale, the entire CRSALE purchases will be refunded
* Starting 21st day of the pre-sale, 10% of purchased CRSALE will be reserved every day, for Crypti issuance at the end of the pre-sale
